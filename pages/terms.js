            Remake will attempt to service your product as described and for the charges shown on the Work Receipt plus any applicable tax. Remake may restrict service to one (1) product per customer during your visit to a repair party session. The service offered by Remake is not covered by any warranty.

          <p className="lead description">Remake understands that your data may be valuable to you. <strong>Data loss during service is always a possibility</strong>, and in some cases, data may be unrecoverable, erased, or reformatted during service. For this reason, it is your sole responsibility to back up all existing data, software, and/or programs from your product, and to decide whether to erase any such data from your product, prior to receiving service. Remake is not responsible for loss, recovery, or compromise of data, software or programs, or loss of use of your product or other equipment arising out of the services provided by Remake. You represent that your product does not contain any illegal files or data.</p>
          <p className="lead description">For this reason, it's recommended that you <strong>back up your device and wipe it prior to submission for service</strong>. Remake technicians and team abide by strict confidentiality rules, and will try to preserve your privacy in all instances, yet this does not guarantee against a potential data leakage, for which Remake is not responsible.</p>

            <strong>Remake reserves the right to return the product to you without servicing it</strong>. Remake services have not been officially authorised by any hardware manufacturer. Consequently, Remake will not be responsible for any damage to the product that occurs during the repair process. If damage results, Remake will seek your authorization for any additional costs for completing service even if the product is covered by warranty. In most scenarios, however, Remake’s service will equate to voiding your warranty contract with the device’s manufacturer. If you decline authorization, Remake may return your product unrepaired in the damaged condition without any responsibility.
